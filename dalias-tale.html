<article class="story-content" id="storyContent">

    <p>"Just keep walking!" the old lady shouts. Our heads low, eyes sore, and legs too heavy to lift; I wonder when this endless march will end and so does the little boy next to me who's clearly reached his limit. "How much farther?" He asks. Too tired to give him a response and too focused on avoiding the large tree roots beneath my beaten feet, I tell him to keep walking and he starts to sob. Snot drips from his nose as he begs to go home. He trips on a root falling to his hands and knees. He tries to get up, but his knees buckle, and he collapses. I extend my hand, which he eagerly grips. His grip is weak. Scabs and bruises cover his arms and legs and his left eye appears shut, swollen from the onslaught of mosquito bites it has received these past few days. He looks pathetic. I heave him to his feet. "Moove!" a kid behind us barks in distress.</p>

    <p>As we begin to walk again, I start to hear a commotion coming from the tail ends of our caravan. A loud booming sound crackles through the air. Blood rushes from my thighs to my eyes and ears, and a sense of fatigue grips my arms. A kid farther back lets out a loud, desperate wail as the sound of his body hitting the forest floor echoes through our ears.</p>

    <p>The old lady begins to shout frantically. "Hide," she cries, "hide and keep your voice down." I desperately scan the forest floor, unaware of the little boy standing next to me. In the distance, I notice a large tree with vines around its base and decide to run towards it. At the base, I find a small hole. I push the vines covering the hole aside and burrow inside.</p>

    <p>A few seconds pass, and I notice something touching my palm. Unable to see what it is, I jerk my hand away. A trickling sound suddenly fills the hole, and a strong odor forces me to cover my nose. I let out a sigh of relief.</p>

    <p>"You know the smell of pee helps them catch us quicker," I say. "I am sorry," a voice says in response. The voice appears to be that of the little boy who I assume followed me into the hole. "It's okay," I say, "just be quiet." "Okay," he says. A few minutes pass and the boy begins to move around. "Stop that," I say. "Okay," he says. "I want to go home," he says. "Shh!" I say. Though, I also want to go home. I want to see my mother again. I want this endless march to end, and to be able to experience those tranquil, carefree days once more.</p>

    <div class="scene-break"></div>

    <p>I miss those days so much. Though, I can't seem to quite remember when it all ended. Those days feel so long ago. But, I remember my mother and the hard work she put in each day to keep us alive. She would scavenge the forest each morning looking for edible nuts and plants for us to eat. Sometimes, I would accompany her only to find myself being lectured on every animal, plant, or piece of dirt in the forest.</p>

    <p>When my mother wasn't lecturing me, I would visit a little mucky stream surrounded by palm trees. In the stream, a school of tiny fat silver minnows with long green stripes running from their gills to the end of their tails swam around as if they had lost something very important and needed to find or get to it immediately. I would sit for hours on the shore of the stream, watching the minnows swim and try to guess which direction they would swim. After my time at the stream, I would return to our little straw hut. My mother always waited outside dressed in a beautiful multicolored dress accompanied by a silver leaf-shaped necklace loosely fixed around her neck. She always had a basket full of plants, colored rocks, and other goods in her arm. She would tell me to wash my face and get ready. I wore a dress as well, but unlike her dress, mine was just yellow and had tears on the inside. Once I was ready, we would begin our daily walk to the village marketplace.</p>

    <aside class="story-pullquote">
        She would pick me up and hold me in her right arm while her left arm carried the empty basket. I could tell she was tired. Yet, she would always sing as her legs struggled to carry us home.
    </aside>

    <p>For the most part, the village marketplace was a busy and loud place. Vendors stood side by side on either side of the dirt and gravel road. They yelled and sang catchy phrases trying to get our attention. They sold anything and everything. If we wanted a spice to repel snakes, we could find several different vendors, all selling the same spice. A group of kids would often run around playing and attacking one another with sticks, pebbles, or any other object they could get their hands on. I didn't care much for their games and stood close to my mother's side. We would go from vendor to vendor, never actually buying anything. We would then stop at a square-shaped stone building with a sign titled "Restful pleasure."</p>

    <p>A tall man stood outside the building. He would take my mother's basket and hand her a bunch of paper with weird symbols and people on it. At this point, my mother would turn to me and tell me to wait outside while she went in. Strange men frequently entered and exited the building. They would stare at me as if I was an object that they would soon possess. I hated waiting outside that building, and my mother wouldn't come out until sunset. When she did come out, I was often asleep. She would pick me up and hold me in her right arm while her left arm carried the empty basket. I could tell she was tired. Yet, she would always sing as her legs struggled to carry us home.</p>

    <p>Tears begin to fall from my cheek. I realize that my mother isn't here and that I am alone with this boy in a piss filled hole.</p>

    <div class="scene-break"></div>

    <p>Hearing my sobbing, the little boy reaches for both of my hands. "Shh," he says. "Okay," I say, trying to compose myself. I let out a few deep breaths and sniffle one last time. The hole once again falls silent. But, the silence is quickly interrupted by a low animal-like roar. "I am hungry," the boy quietly says, which makes me realize that my own body has, for some time, been begging me for food. "Okay," I tell him. "Stay here." I make my way toward the holes entrance. Slowly parting the vines, I peek my head out and notice that it is starting to get dark outside. The sky has a red and orange hue with splotches of yellow. The forest is relatively silent. Only a few birds make noise as they say goodbye to one another on their way to their nests.</p>

    <p>"Is it safe?" the boy asks. "I am not sure," I say, "hold on." I keep my head poked out for a few minutes scanning and listening attentively. "Okay, It's safe." The boy's head quickly appears right next to mine. "Let's go," I say, "before it gets dark."</p>

    <p>Walking a few feet from the hole, we start to scavenge the forest floor. We use the bottoms of our shirts and fold them up towards our stomachs, creating a small pouch. The little boy works diligently and soon has a handful of nuts in his pouch. "You're a good scavenger," I say to him. "I am just hungry," he says, "and I want to eat a lot, so I have to get a lot of food." "You're right," I say. "Do you have a name?" "Yes," he says enthusiastically "my name is Asher." "Asher?" "Yes." "Oh, okay," I say, "My name is Dalia." The boy looks up at me, smiles and continues to pick up nuts off the forest floor. I see him pick up a few poisonous nuts off the floor, and before he could put them in his pouch, I swat them out of his hands. "Don't pick those up, they are not safe." He nods in agreement and continues to look for other nuts. I grab the nuts off the ground and put them into my pouch.</p>

    <p>A few hours pass and at this point the sky has lost its red and orange hue and is now black. The ground is barely visible, and our scavenging has led us further away from the hole. "We should go back," I say as I struggle to hold up my pouch, which overflows with nuts and berries. As we walk back, Asher starts to eat some of the nuts and berries he gathered. "Don't eat them all! Save some for later." "Mmmhmm Okay," he says, shoveling another fist full of berries into his mouth. I can't help but laugh. My mother once scolded me for eating in one sitting all the nuts, she had gathered that day. "I am serious," I tell him, lightly hitting the top of his head.</p>

    <p>The walk back to the hole takes longer than it should. I am not entirely sure that we are going in the right direction, and it's hard to tell where we are going. Asher suddenly trips and falls. "Are you okay?" I ask. "Yeah, I am okay. I just tripped over something." He begins to walk back to where he fell to retrieve some of the nuts he dropped.</p>

    <p>"Dalia! Come here, come here." As I approach him, I notice a strange figure lying on the ground. "What is that?" I ask, "Is it alive?" I move to touch the figure and stop short after hearing it groan in pain. "What should we do, Dalia?" I don't give him a response. Memories of the past start to slowly crowd my head. The day before my mother and I split up pushes itself forward blurring my vision.</p>

    <div class="scene-break"></div>

    <p>Our morning routine that day was the same as it had always been. By the afternoon, we were on our way to the village market. Though, there were few people at the marketplace that day, and strange men holding large guns walked along the gravel paved road. They had on green and tan colored uniforms with the symbol of a snake stitched on to their shoulders.</p>

    <p>My mother decided to take me inside the square building. A lady with curly black hair sat behind a flat stone counter. "You need to be careful," she said to my mother. "I will be fine," my mother replied. The lady seemed unconvinced. "If they find out who you are, that you and your daughter are," My mother gave her a stern look before she could finish. "Of course," the lady said, "You will be fine," She looked at me, smiled, and handed me a little straw doll. My mother told me to sit and wait on the stone bench near the entrance. She then opened a large wooden door next to where the lady at the counter was sitting and vanished. She didn't spend too much time inside the building, and we were home before sunset.</p>

    <aside class="story-pullquote">
        "There was nothing we could do to help them. I had to protect you."
    </aside>

    <p>As we got ready for bed that night, we heard a knock. My mother opened our small wooden door to find a man and woman standing outside. "Can we please rest here for the night?" the man asked. "We don't have very much space," my mother responded. "Please," said the woman," The soldiers have gotten more aggressive." "It won't be for long," the man said, sounding more desperate. My mother just stood in the doorway examining them. "I don't know," she said." They don't come out this far away from the village." "They've gotten more agitated and have been going beyond the village. We fled our home before they arrived," the man said.</p>

    <p>He and my mother continued arguing until the sound of marching boots and shouting interrupted them. "You have to leave; I am sorry," my mother told them as she started to close the door. The man jammed his foot in front of the door making it hard for my mother to close. He began to curse at her. The woman attempted to pull him away from the door. "I am sorry," my mother said, giving the door a hard push shutting it.</p>

    <p>My mother picked me up and cupped her hands around my ears. Though her hands covered my ears, I could still hear the marching men as they got closer and closer to our hut. The voice of one of the men shouting orders echoed throughout the forest. "After them," he said. "It's okay Dalia," she whispered. "There was nothing we could do to help them. I had to protect you."</p>

    <div class="scene-break"></div>

    <p>"Dalia, what should we do!" Asher asks, pulling hard on my arm. "Leave," I say. Asher doesn't move or say anything. "Come on; we can't take him with us. We have to get back to the hole." I try to grab his arm and pull him away. But, he dodges my hand. "Asher, we can't save him. He's been like this for a while and will die soon." He doesn't seem to be listening to a word I am saying. I continue to plead my case to him until the distant sound of men's voices interrupts me.</p>

    <p>The voices get closer. "Find them," I hear a voice shout. Asher starts to walk away from the body, and I find myself unsure of what to do. The body is still alive and there is a bush that we could all hide in not too far from us. But, the safest place for Asher and I is the hole. We could try to carry the body back to hole, but I don't know where the hole is.</p>

    <p>I know that the safest thing for us to do is to leave the body. The soldiers will stop to examine it, giving us enough time to escape. But, I can't let it end like last time. I have to do something. "Okay," I say as I grab Asher's hand. "We have to be fast," I tell him. He nods and we move to either side of the boy's body. "Lift the feet, and I will lift the hands. We will have to drag him." He lets out a loud groan as we drag him across the forest floor towards the bush.</p>

    <p>A procession of marching men appears in front of us. The boy continues to make light groans. I place my hand over its mouth. The men suddenly stop, and bright lights appear from their foreheads. The lights travel in every direction, revealing much of the forest. My eyes carefully follow a few of the lights. I find myself suddenly blinded by one of the lights. "I think I found something," a man yells excitedly. "Get farther back," I tell Asher. The light gets closer until it appears right above us. The man stands above me and begins to reach inside the bush. Asher, now further back inside the bush, holds on to my fingertips. The man's probing hands get closer and closer until they find themselves touching the boy's ankles. I grab a few of the poisonous nuts from my pouch and throw them out of the bush. The man's attention turns towards the nuts now rolling on the forest floor. He runs over to pick them up quickly. "Finally," he says, picking the nuts off the ground and stuffing them into his mouth. "Find anything?" another man asks. "Nah, nothing," he says, "go on without me, I will keep looking here." Several minutes later, the man starts to stumble around. He sits down with his back leaning up against a large palm tree. He becomes agitated and swings his arms through the air as if swatting something. Some time passes, and his body stops moving. I tell Asher to stay inside the bush and walk towards the man's body. His head is tilted downwards with the light from his helmet illuminating the forest. I don't regret doing what I did. I did what I had to keep it from being like last time. I did it to keep Asher safe and to bring this endless march closer to its end.</p>
