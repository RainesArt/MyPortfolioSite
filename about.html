                    <h2>Where I Began</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was born in a small village in Liberia, toward the end
                        of the Second Liberian Civil War. For a young child, the
                        village seemed peaceful. Each morning I would bathe with
                        a large oval-shaped bowl and then walk into the forest
                        to a stream where I spent hours catching minnows with my
                        bare hands. In the evenings the men would return from
                        hunting. Once they came back carrying an enormous
                        python, and the women cut it up for a stew in a large
                        pot with spices I could not name.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>

        <!-- Narrative -->

                <p>
                    I moved to the United States as a young child, settling
                    first with my adoptive family in Kentucky before eventually
                    reaching Chicago. At Dartmouth, I studied Economics and
                    Public Policy, drawn to the ways quantitative methods could
                    be applied to questions about how people make decisions
                    under constraint.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My first research project examined the impact of violence on
                    educational attainment for children in Nigeria. The work
                    sharpened my interest in microeconomics and in the tools
                    economists use to measure harm. For my honors thesis, I
                    turned to Tanzania and a question about what happens to
                    school enrollment when the price of gold rises. Using three
                    rounds of the Tanzanian National Panel Survey and a
                    difference-in-differences strategy, I compared households
                    that varied in their proximity to artisanal and industrial
                    gold mines. I found that a sixty-two percent increase in the
                    price of gold led to an 18.6 percentage point decline in
                    enrollment among individuals fourteen to seventeen years old
                    living within thirty kilometers of an artisanal mine.
                    Household wealth increased at the same time. The opportunity
                    cost of schooling, it turns out, rises with the price of
                    gold.

                <blockquote>
                    The circumstances of a person's early life, and the economic
                    environment surrounding them, shape outcomes in ways that
                    are difficult to reverse once they take hold.
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    After graduation, I worked as a municipal bonds analyst at
                    Nuveen, where I focused on general obligation bonds, charter
                    school bonds, and multi-family housing projects. The role
                    gave me a view into how capital markets interact with the
                    communities around them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now, as a Research Analyst at the Early Childhood Research
                    Alliance of Chicago (EC*REACH), I work with city agencies to
                    clean, organize, and analyze administrative data on early
                    childhood education. I led a project to unduplicate children
                    across seven administrative databases using probabilistic
                    matching techniques and have contributed to several papers
                    evaluating Chicago's Universal Pre-K program.
