                    <h2>Where I Began</h2>
                    <p>
                        I was born in a small village in Liberia, toward the end
                        of the Second Liberian Civil War. To a young child, life
                        there seemed almost impossibly peaceful. Each morning,
                        I'd bathe with a giant oval-shaped bowl, then wander
                        into the forest to a mucky stream where I'd spend hours
                        catching minnows with my bare hands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After playing in the forest, I'd return to the village
                        for the evening meal. One day, the men came back
                        carrying an enormous python. The women set to work
                        immediately, cutting it up for a stew, preparing a large
                        pot with spices I couldn't name.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Narrative -->
        <section class="narrative">
            <div class="narrative__content">
                <p class="narrative__lead">
                    My path from Liberia to the United States was neither
                    straight nor simple.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I arrived in the U.S. as a young child, settling first with
                    family in New Jersey before eventually making my way to the
                    Midwest. The transition was jarring in ways that are hard to
                    articulate. Language, culture, climate - everything was
                    different. But what stayed constant was a deep curiosity
                    about how the world works, and a growing awareness that the
                    circumstances of your birth shape your life in ways most
                    people never fully reckon with.

                <blockquote>
                    The question that drives my work is deceptively simple: why
                    do some children get a fair shot and others don't?
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    At Dartmouth, I studied Economics and Geography, drawn to
                    the intersection of quantitative rigor and real-world
                    complexity. My undergraduate research took me in two
                    directions that would define my career. First, I examined
                    the impact of violence on educational attainment for
                    children in Nigeria. The project was eye-opening, not just
                    for what I found, but for what it revealed about the tools
                    economists have to measure harm, and the limits of those
                    tools. It's where my interest in microeconomics took root.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For my honors thesis, I turned to Tanzania and a puzzle that
                    seemed, at first glance, counterintuitive: what happens to
                    school enrollment when gold prices rise? Using three rounds
                    of the Tanzanian National Panel Survey and a
                    difference-in-differences strategy, I found that higher gold
                    prices led to lower enrollment among children living near
                    artisanal mines. Families got wealthier, but kids left
                    school. The opportunity cost of education, it turns out,
                    rises with the price of gold.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After graduation, I wanted to understand the other side of
                    the equation: how capital markets shape the choices
                    available to families and communities. As a municipal bonds
                    analyst at Nuveen, I focused on general obligation bonds,
                    charter school bonds, and multi-family housing projects.
                    What I learned was sobering. Market forces don't just
                    respond to inequities. They can perpetuate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, as a Research Analyst at the Early Childhood Research
                    Alliance of Chicago (EC*REACH), I work with city agencies in
                    Chicago to clean, organize, and analyze administrative data
                    on early childhood education. I led a project to unduplicate
                    children across seven administrative databases using
                    probabilistic matching techniques. I've contributed to
                    several papers evaluating Chicago's Universal Pre-K program.
                    The work is technical, but the stakes are not. Behind every
                    record is a child, and behind every policy decision is the
                    question of whether we're giving that child a fair shot.
