            <h2>Where I Began</h2>
            <p>I was born in a small village in Liberia towards the end of the Second Liberian Civil War. My life there seemed very peaceful. Each morning, I would bathe myself with a giant oval-shaped bowl, then go into the forest to a mucky stream where I would catch minnows with my hands.</p>
            <p>After playing in the forest, I would return to the village to eat the meal caught by the hunters, who used primitive spears and bows. One day, the hunters came back carrying an enormous python. The women began cutting it up for a stew, preparing a large pot with all sorts of spices. When the signal was given for us to eat, I did so without hesitation.</p>

        <p class="narrative__lead">These tranquil, carefree days would soon be over as the remnants of the war finally reached my village.</p>

        <p>I don't quite recall when I was forced to leave, but I remember that the events following my departure were filled with terror. In an attempt to keep us out of danger, we, the children of the village, were constantly moved around. One time, enemy soldiers were spotted in our vicinity, and one almost caught me, walking just a few feet from my hiding place.</p>

        <p>I remember feeling as if the world around me froze. The only sound I could hear was my heart pounding in my chest. My body felt as if some invisible weight was pressing down on me. I had never felt so afraid before. It wasn't until one of our guardians said we were safe that the weight lifted.</p>

        <p>Several years later, at the age of eight, I was adopted, moving from Liberia - the only place I had ever known - to a white, suburban household outside of Chicago. It was a stark contrast. I was suddenly in a completely alien society. These memories, specifically the constant uncertainty and fear I felt during the war and the disorientation of my new life, stay with me. They motivate me today to pursue graduate study, to equip myself with the tools necessary to help provide others with insights into difficult economic questions, so that the childhoods of others are not also defined by conflict.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <div class="journey__content">
        <p>My journey into economics research began with a desire to understand the challenges faced by individuals and families in developing nations. At Dartmouth College, I examined the impact of violence on educational attainment for children in Nigeria, which established my interest in microeconomics.</p>

        <p>For my undergraduate honors thesis, I examined the relationship between fluctuations in the price of gold and educational attainment in Tanzania. Using data from three rounds of the Tanzanian National Panel Survey and employing a difference-in-differences strategy, I found that as the price of gold increased, school enrollment dropped significantly among individuals living near artisanal gold mines.</p>

        <p>To better understand how capital markets might influence economic decisions, I worked as a municipal bonds analyst at Nuveen, focusing on general obligation bonds, charter school bonds, and multi-family housing projects. This work taught me how market forces can sometimes perpetuate inequities.</p>

        <p>Currently, as a Data Analyst at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University, I work with city agencies in Chicago to clean, organize, and analyze administrative data on early childhood education. I led a project to unduplicate children across seven administrative databases using probabilistic matching techniques, and have contributed to several papers evaluating Chicago's Universal Pre-K program.</p>
