# Arthur Raine's Portfolio
<p>Hi! I am Arthur. Welcome to this GitHub repository, where you can find code and projects that I've worked on and am working on. To get started, I primarily work in C++, Python, and Stata. However, I am doing my best to learn Rust.</p>
<ul>
  <li> Stata Code: This contains Stata do files with code from projects I've worked on. Currently, it contains two files: data_cleaning_code and code_book_generator_code. data_cleaning_code contains some useful code snippets, like selecting a random variable value from past projects. The code_book_generator_code is code that creates a formatted data dictionary/codebook from a Stata dataset based on Northwestern's color scheme </li>
</ul>
