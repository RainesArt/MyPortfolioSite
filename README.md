## About Me
<p>Hey! I’m Arthur. I’m a Liberian American, former (and recovering) Kentuckian, and current Illinoisian. I’m a proud Dartmouth College graduate, where I earned my economics degree with high honors and minored in public policy. I've worked in education, finance, and public policy. I am driven by a desire to make systems work better for people.</p>
